  <h1>Slabside Revival - Teardown</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Alright, here we go .... Plastics removed, ready to get torn to pieces. I have no idea if there is a certain way to do this so I'll just start from the "outside" and work my way in. I plan on taking this down as far as I dare so 1st thing is to remove the instrument cluster and the wire harness, starting with identifying and labeling every wire in the system.

    <br><br><br>Got the wire harness out, it doesn't look too bad in this picture but some wires have been repaired with a newer wire with a DIFFERENT COLOR... WHY ?!?!?! and instead of a proper solder joint and a shrink-tube someone thought it was better to use WIRENUTS &#128534; to me that's like nails on a Blackboard. I am not sure what to do with this - at the moment of writing I am considering junking the existing harness and re-wire the whole bike, that way I can also make some sort of controller for the bikes electrical system, route the wires inside the frame and use some more modern components.
