  <h1>Slabside Revival - Purchase</h1>
  <br>
  <p>After having restored a 1984 Kawasaki GPz 1100 I started to look for another project bike, and in 2012 I saw a Craigslist ad on this 1986 GSXR 1100 (yes I like the big-bore bikes) and for not a lot of money.
    <br>I got in contact with the seller and after a brief conversation I agreed to drive to Los Angeles to take a in-person look.
    <br>On the phone with the seller, he explained that he didn't want to give me his address, instead he instructed me to drive to a general area and to give him a call him once I got there, then he would guide me through the surface streets to his place - strange but perhaps his place was difficult to find based on an address.
    <br>Arriving at his place he greeted me and showed the bike..... this guy is a good photographer, the bike was rusty, plastics were cracked and in a pretty bad shape, the front brake didn't work and ran really rough so I never rode it myself, the owner took it up and down the street a couple of times to show it infact COULD run.
    <br>I initially declined purchasing the bike as it required too much work, and as I was about to drive back home the wife/girlfriend of the seller came out and started an argument with the seller about money and which car had the most gas for a grocery run. It was obvious they were hurting for money and were selling their assets to raise some cash, so I re-negotiated the price and got him to throw a few boxes of extra spare parts into the deal.
    <br>Whether the wife/gf stunt was orchestrated or not, I was now on my way home with a special bike on the trailer.
    
    <br><br>Then the bike sat in my garage for approx. 10 years - yup, why procrastinate today when you can do it tomorrow :-)

    <br><br>I saved the pictures from the ad along with pictures of the bike when I first saw it, I'll add them here once I find 'em
