  <h1>Slabside Revival - Purchase</h1>
  <br>
  <p>After having restored a 1984 GPz 1100 I started to look for another project bike, and in 2012 I saw a Craigslist ad on this 1986 GSXR 1100 (yes I like the big-bore bikes) and for not a lot of money.<br>
    I got in contact with the seller and after a brief conversation I agreed to drive to Los Angeles to take a in-person look. <br>
    On the phone with the seller, he explained that he didn't want to give me his address, instead he instructed me to drive to a general area and to give him a call him once I got there, then he would guide me through the surface streets to his place - strange but maybe his place is difficult to find based on an address.<br>
    Arriving at his place he greeted me and showed the bike..... this guy is a good photographer, the bike was rusty, plastics were cracked and in a pretty bad shape, the front brake didn't work and ran really rough so I never rode it myself, but the owner rode it up and down the street to show it infact COULD run.<br>
    I initially declined purchasing the bike as it required too much work, and as I was about to drive back home the wife/girlfriend of the seller came out and started an argument with the seller about money and which car had the most gas for a grocery run. I could understand these people was hurting for money and were starting to sell of what they could, so I re-negotiated the price and got him to throw his boxes of extra spare parts into the deal.<br>
    On my way home I realized I had forgotten a part, so I drove back to the sellers house - here I met him very confused about how I could find his house again ?!?!?! Anyway, I drove home that day with a new (to me) bike on the trailer.
