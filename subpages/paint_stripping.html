    Slabside Revival - Paint Stripping
  </h1>
  <br>
  <p>I started to strip the paint off the plastics, I will look for them.<br><br>
    Here are some pictures of the tank getting stripped. This is a time consuming process, there was 5-6 layers of paint on it. I started with a quart of paint stripper, that took me throught stripping the paint of all the plastics with a little amount of stripper to spare.<br>
    The tank is for some reason a different story, I have so far used 1/2 gallon of paint stripper by painting it on the tank, carefully covering up in Cling-Wrap, waiting sometimes an hour and other times I let it sit for days. There are still big patches of paint that the stripper can't get through. The stripper ate all the way to the metal in some places but in others there are patches of a thick black paint that the stripper is not really biting on, it's more like a liner of sorts - it feels plasticy to the touch and is much much thicker than the 'real' paint. Is this thick black layer a 'rescue' paint that can seal a rusty and leaking tank from the outside ? Once I get all the paint off I'll clean and de-rustify the inside and seal it with POR-15
