    Slabside Revival - Paint Stripping
  </h1>
  <br>
  <p>I started to strip the paint off the plastics, I will look for them.<br><br>
    Here are some pictures of the tank getting stripped. This is a time consuming process, there was 5-6 layers of paint on it. I started with a quart of paint stripper, that took me throught stripping the paint of all the plastics.<br>
    The tank is for some reason a different story, I have so far used 1/2 gallon of paint stripper by painting it on the tank, carefully covering up in Cling-Wrap and let it sit until I can see the paint release and wrinkle up. Likw with the plastics, there are several layers of paint of different color and thickness, someplaces the stripper ate all the way to the metal and in others there are patches of a thick black paint that the stripper is not really biting on, it's more like a liner of sorts - it feels plasticy to the touch and is much much thicker than the other layers of paint. Is this thick black layer a 'rescue' paint that can seal a rusty and leaking tank from the outside ? Once I get all the paint off the outside and the rust off the inside I should be able to spot any pin-holes.

    Jan 2023 - Home from Christmas vacation and back on the build. The stripper that I had painted on the last patches of paint did nothing after sitting for 2 weeks so I decided to sand off the rest of the paint. Starting to look better.
