  <h1>Slabside Revival - Oil Clearance</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Before I start putting the bike back I need to make sure the internals aren't too worn or have issues that will require me to tear into the engine again. To ensure the crankshaft bearings are properly lubicated it's important there is a gap between the crankshaft journal and its bearing. The factory specifies 0.020 -> 0.044mm</p>

  <p>Measuring the oil clearance is easies done with a Plastigage which is a Wax string you lay on the Journals, mount and torque down it's mating part, dismantle and observe how far the Plastigage has squeezed, the width of the squeezed Plastigage is a measurement of the clearance between the 2 mating surfaces. In the picture below the thin green strip of Plastigage is resting on the main bearing Journals, assemble the 2 crankcase halves and torque the main bearing bolts to spec. then disassemble and observe the squeeze.</p>

  <p>Below are the results from main bearing #1-6, click on them to zoom.</p><br>

  <p>A few of the Journals had grooves that would catch a finger nail when running perpendicular to the direction, these grooves can be taken down by a piece of emerald paper of a high grid count, wrapped around the Journal so it fits exactly one time around, then wrap a long shoelace around the paper and perform a light back-and-forth sanding. The Journals are hardened and the paper will not remove any material, it'll just knock down the grooves.</p>
