  <h1>Slabside Revival</h1>
  <p>This web page is to document my attempt to convert a basket-case of a motorcycle I bought over 10 years ago, into a decent running bike. The bike is a Suzuki GSXR 1100 from 1986, one of the fastest bikes of it's time and an icon for teenage boys :-)<br>  
  </p>
  <p>This site is <b>not</b> a How-To in any way, but rather my photos, notes, etc. compiled and made public for your to dig through, laugh at and hopefully send me a comment.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Below are some images of what this bike looked like when it was new:<br>
